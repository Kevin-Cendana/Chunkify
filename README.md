Chunkify is a task list with a twist: AI breaks down your tasks into smaller chunks. Chunkify is perfect for those who get overwhelmed easily, such as those with ADHD.

# Current Status: In Development

Chunkify is passion project of mine. It's an idea that I have had for a while now - I've always wanted an app to further optimize everything I do.

The project came to fruition at the [AI Hackathon @ CSUS](https://lu.ma/o2sau79c) in March 2024, and I plan to continue development until the app is in a complete, releasable state.
